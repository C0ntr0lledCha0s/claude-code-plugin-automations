# Research Cache Directory

This directory stores cached research findings to avoid redundant research and build institutional knowledge over time.

## Structure

- `investigations/` - Cached codebase investigations
- `best-practices/` - Cached best practice research
- `patterns/` - Cached pattern analysis
- `comparisons/` - Cached comparative analyses

Each cached research includes metadata (YAML frontmatter) and the research content.

## Privacy

By default, this directory is tracked in git to enable team knowledge sharing. To make it private:

1. Add to `.gitignore`: `research-agent/.research-cache/`
2. Each team member maintains their own local cache

See `scripts/cache-manager.py` for cache management commands.
